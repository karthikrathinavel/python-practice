Array Rotation:
 1. Initialize an main array arr[] and temp[]
 2. Get the number of elements you would like to append to the array(list in python)
 3. Get the elements using loop statement
 4. Print the array after get elements(if needed)
 5. Get the number of elements to be rotate
 6. Append the elements to be rotated in the temp[]
 7. Delete the appended elements to temp[] from arr[]
 8. perform arr+temp. Here we get the rotated array
